## Definition:
The total fertility rate is determined by adding up the
age-specific fertility rates of the reference year for all
women aged between 15 and 44 or 15 and 49 years. It is
defined as the average number of children a woman would have
during her lifetime if the conditions in the reference year
were characteristic of the whole period of her childbearing
years (from 15 to 44 or 49). The total fertility rate
required to replace the population depends on the sex ratio
of the live-born children and the mortality conditions.
