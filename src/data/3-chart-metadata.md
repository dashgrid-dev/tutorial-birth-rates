## Definition:
Stillborn children are children who have not shown any signs
of life, but whose birth weight is at least 500 grams or
had reached the 24th week of pregnancy. They are included
in the statistics of births. If the weight of the foetus is
less than 500 grams and had not reached the 24th week of
pregnancy, it is a miscarriage. Miscarriages are not shown
in the civil status records. Until October 31, 2018, a
birth weight of at least 500 grams had been used to
distinguish stillbirths from miscarriages, and until March
31, 1994, a birth weight of at least 1,000 grams had been
used. Until 30 June 1979, children with a minimum body
length of 35 cm were regarded as stillborn. Consequently,
children not born alive whose body length was under 35 cm
were regarded as miscarriages at that time.
