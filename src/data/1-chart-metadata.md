## Definition:
The difference between live-born and stillborn children is
laid down in the "Ordinance Implementing the Civil Status
Act (PStV)". According to these provisions, live-born
children are newborns whose heart beat, whose umbilical
cord pulsed or whose natural lung respiration commenced
after separation from the mother’s body.
Until the end of 1957, children whose natural lung
respiration had commenced were regarded as live born.

Monthly birth figures refer to the event month. All
provisional values are updated monthly, as births for
previous months can be subsequently reported.
